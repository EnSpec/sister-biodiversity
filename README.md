# sister-biodiversity

This repository contains code for calculating alpha and beta spectral diversity metrics. Methods were
adapted from Féret & de Boissieu (2020) but do not exactly replicate their techniques. We have included both a command line scripts
which can automatically generate diversity metrics with user specfied parameters along with an interactive
Jupyter notebook (*recommended*).
